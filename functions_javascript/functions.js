// Functions in JavaScript
// Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.

// Functions play a central role in programming and software development, allowing you to encapsulate reusable and included blocks of code. 
// They can be set to perform specific tasks, from simple calculations to complex data manipulation. 
// Functions in JavaScript can have or not have parameters, as well as return values ​​or not.

// Its use is essential to create dynamic, interactive and efficient JavaScript applications. However, you don't need to create all types of functions at this point.

// Example of a function in JavaScript
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello, World!');
}

// Calling the function
sayHello(); // Output: Hello, World!
